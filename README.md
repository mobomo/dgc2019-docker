# DGC2019 Training Files
Thanks for joining us for training at Drupal GovCon 2019!

This repository is meant to compliment the presentation given at Drupal
GovCon regarding local development with containers. All files that are 
touched over the course of the presentation will be available in this
repository in each of versions as they're modified.

You can follow along with the presentation on [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZM_ukcIRbZNN7CzKHndbwRW_bsQgUCZHzj6iDsbZw80/edit?usp=sharing).

## How To Use This Repo

As files are modified, the presentation will make mention of which files
should reflect the current changes. You can edit the files yourself if
you're comfortable or copy the files directly from the repository.

Some slides in the presentation use entire directories. In this case, copy
the entire directory to your project as directed.

Note that these files (especially the Drupal files like settings.php) were
specifically made for version 8.7.5 There are no guarantees that these files
will continue to work into the future.

## Pre-Packaged Solution

All of the items this training has gone over (plus many more) have been packaged
into a repository that's ready to bootstrap any Drupal 8 project.

For more information, visit the [Drupal Dev Docker](https://github.com/DrupalStand/drupal-dev-docker)
GitHub page and checkout the readme.
